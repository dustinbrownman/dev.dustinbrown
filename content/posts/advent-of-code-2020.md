This time every year the Advent of Code comes out, and I'm intrigued. If you don't know what it is, it's a daily coding challenge that runs from December 1 - 25. There's usually a cute story that goes along with it to give a vague premise for each of the puzzles. Along with the daily puzzle, there's always a bonus challenge that will net you an extra star. I usually do a few days before I either forget about it, or the puzzles start requiring some serious computer science knowledge that's beyond me.

I've been having fun so far this year, and wanted to share some neat things I got to try out and learn.

Day 1 - Get Set

The first day's puzzle involved finding the two numbers in a list that add up to 2020. For this one, I knew I was going to have to go through the list of numbers and find if there was a matching pair...Talk about using `Set` to solve this puzzle. Maybe something about the bonus challenge.

Maybe this is where the post ends?

Day 2 - Password policy

Here I'd like to talk a about the benefits of good interfaces as requirements change. The password policy was one way, then another, but only the calculation had to change.

Day 3 - Trees!

This is about anticipating needs. The original function was built to handle any slope even though at first it only required one slope. I honestly think it would have been harder and messier to "hard code" it for the original slope. There's a benefit to thinking about the problem and teasing apart the parts that matter.

Day 4 - Passport problems

I'm not sure I love this. Or at least it felt like it involved the most busy work in order to write each of the validators. But sometimes I guess that's just the way things go. Combine what you can if it makes sense, but bespoke pieces of logic are just going to be a thing.

(also maybe something about Regex's being so handy some times)

Day 5 - Where's my seat

I don't think I've ever really had to use binary in my every day job, but having a working understanding of it can be handy for coding puzzle type stuff. I felt like I was cheating a little bit by straight translating the input into binary, but ultimately I think that's what the puzzle-writer was intending.
