## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host discusses various job data reports that will be released throughout the week, including the quits rate, private payrolls, layoff announcements, and the August jobs report. One key focus is on wage growth, which appears to be slowing. Employers are posting lower wage growth rates, indicating less demand for workers and potentially lower inflationary pressures. Small businesses are particularly affected by the cool down in the job market, with slower wage growth and reduced job additions. The podcast also touches on other topics such as the strain on the Texas power grid due to rising temperatures and growing cities, as well as the investment in passenger rail. Overall, there are concerns about job data and wage growth trends, and the potential impact on the labor market and the economy.

## Highlights

- **Wage growth may be slowing further:** Average hourly earnings have slowed from 5.8% in April to 4.7% in July, potentially returning to pre-pandemic levels by December.
- **Peach crop losses impact prices:** Unusual weather conditions have led to crop losses of up to 90% in certain regions, causing prices to rise by as much as 50% for specialty retail items like Native American art.
- **Engagement declines for remote workers:** Employees who work fully remote have an eroding connection to the mission and purpose of their organization, with only 28% strongly feeling connected, tying a record low.
