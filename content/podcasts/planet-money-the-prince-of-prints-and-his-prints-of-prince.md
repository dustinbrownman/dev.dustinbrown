## Summary

This episode of the podcast explores the complex issue of transformative use in copyright law. It begins with the story of photographer Lynn Goldsmith, who took a portrait of musician Prince in 1981, which was later transformed by artist Andy Warhol for a magazine cover. Goldsmith later discovered a different version of the portrait, with Warhol's alterations, and sought compensation for its use. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which considered the question of when copying someone's work becomes fair use or stealing. The court ultimately ruled in Goldsmith's favor, emphasizing the importance of the market and the need to protect artists' rights to profit from their work. The decision highlights the tension between creativity and commerce in the art world.
