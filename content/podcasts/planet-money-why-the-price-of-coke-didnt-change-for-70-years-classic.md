## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts explore the intriguing story of why the price of a bottle of Coca-Cola remained at a nickel for 70 years, from 1886 to 1959. Despite economic changes, wars, and inflation, Coca-Cola managed to keep the price consistent. The answer lies in a combination of factors: an initial marketing strategy to position Coca-Cola as an affordable drink, a long-term contract with bottlers that fixed the price of syrup, widespread advertising emphasizing the five-cent price, and the prevalence of vending machines that only accepted nickels. The episode explores the psychological aspects of pricing and the challenges faced by Coca-Cola as it tried to raise the price without upsetting its customers. Ultimately, inflation and the end of the gold standard led to the demise of the nickel Coke, but its legacy can still be seen in the larger bottles of Coke available today, which offer a similar price per ounce.
