## Highlights

- **Stability Restored Between US and China**: The meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping restored some stability to the relationship between the US and China, signaling that both countries want to continue doing business in non-sensitive areas. This has important implications for both economies and the global economy.
- **Optimism for Soft Landing of US Economy**: Economists are growing optimistic that the US economy will achieve a soft landing, with inflation moving closer to the target and a labor market that is adding jobs and still on solid footing. There is hope that the hardest part is over and the Federal Reserve has made progress in fighting inflation. However, there are concerns about potential government shutdowns and the US fiscal picture.
- **Controversy Surrounding Crop Insurance Program**: Both liberal and conservative groups have concerns about the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Liberals argue that the program disproportionately benefits wealthy farmers and does not support small farmers, BIPOC farmers, and those growing fruits and vegetables. Conservatives argue that farmers should be able to manage risks themselves in the marketplace and that the program is costly and in need of review.
