## Summary

Kite surfing cargo ships? Yes, it's a real thing. A French company has developed a technology that uses large kites to help offset the fossil fuel consumption of cargo ships. These kites can pull the ships and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20%. The kite flies up to 300 meters above the water and uses figure-eight motions to maximize the pulling effect. While it may not be a long-term solution, it can make a big difference now. Let's hope more shipping companies adopt this technology. #GreenShipping #KiteSurfingCargoShips

## Highlights

- **Highlight 1:** "This is a company that's developing a new technology to offset the fossil fuel consumption of cargo ships by an average of 20%, which is a pretty big deal."
- **Highlight 2:** "These guys believe that they will help the adoption rate of green fuels. They allow green fuels to be introduced sooner both because we save some of the cost making them more competitive, but also because we reduce the amount of green fuel needed on a ship."
- **Highlight 3:** "As fuel prices go up, there will be a much greater adoption of this stuff."
