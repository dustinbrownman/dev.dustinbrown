## Highlights

- **False Advertising Lawsuits on the Rise:** False advertising lawsuits are increasing, with more consumers taking legal action against companies for deceptive marketing practices. The collapse of other regulatory mechanisms and the prevalence of arbitration clauses in contracts have left consumer lawsuits as one of the few avenues for seeking recourse. In particular, the food industry has seen a significant number of claims related to misleading product descriptions and promises.
- **The Rise of Spanglish Advertising:** Advertisers are increasingly using Spanglish, a combination of Spanish and English, to appeal to a diverse and multicultural audience. Companies are recognizing the importance of reaching young consumers who grew up in bilingual households and are proud of their heritage. Spanglish advertising reflects the changing ways in which future generations communicate and connect with brands.
- **Navigating the Path to a Soft Landing:** Economists and Federal Reserve officials are grappling with the challenge of achieving a "soft landing" for the economy, avoiding both high inflation and a sharp downturn. While there are potential risks and uncertainties, such as government shutdowns and rising gas prices, experts remain cautiously optimistic about the possibility of a smooth economic transition.
