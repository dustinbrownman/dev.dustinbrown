## Summary

In this podcast episode, Planet Money dives deep into the history of antitrust laws with a two-part series. The first part focuses on the story of John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil, and how the government intervened to break up the monopoly. The episode highlights the investigative journalist Ida Tarbell, who uncovered Rockefeller's questionable business practices. The second part of the series explores the impact of Robert Bork, a lawyer who transformed the interpretation of antitrust law in favor of big businesses. Bork's book, "The Antitrust Paradox," argued for focusing on consumer welfare rather than protecting competitors, leading to a shift in antitrust policy. The episode discusses how Bork's ideas have shaped the current state of antitrust law and its application to companies like Amazon. The podcast episode provides valuable historical context and raises important questions about the role of government intervention in ensuring fair competition in the marketplace.
