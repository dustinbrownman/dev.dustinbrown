## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host discusses why the plan by OPEC+ to cut oil production in order to raise prices is not working out. The main reason is the low demand for gas worldwide, with factors such as low consumer demand due to the climate crisis and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Additionally, the podcast covers the lowering of the 2023 global trade growth forecast by the WTO and the challenges faced by the American labor market. It also touches on the complex dynamics of inflation, interest rates, and fiscal policies. Overall, the episode delves into the current economic landscape and the various factors affecting it.

## Highlights

- **Inflation is slowing down, but when will prices go back down?** The answer to this question may be unsatisfying. While inflation is expected to slow down, prices may not necessarily decrease. Some prices may remain elevated for a period of time due to factors such as supply chain disruptions and sticky prices. Additionally, deflation, or a widespread decrease in prices, can have negative effects on the economy as it discourages consumer spending.

- **Is the 2% inflation target sustainable forever?** Growing the economy forever is not sustainable. Eventually, there may be a need to pull back and prioritize sustainability, as seen in the growing awareness of climate change and environmental concerns. Economic growth will continue to be a goal, but there may be a shift towards more balanced and sustainable growth in the future.
