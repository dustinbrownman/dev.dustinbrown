## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host explores the economic experiences of the American middle class amidst the current economy. A recent poll showed that 44% of self-identified middle class Americans feel stressed about the economy, while 34% remain optimistic. The rising costs and lower personal savings have contributed to the economic concerns. The personal savings rate has dropped significantly since the pandemic, impacting the ability to build savings. However, economist Justin Wolfers notes that more people are finding work and starting businesses, which contributes to the optimism. The podcast also discusses how the Biden administration is regulating artificial intelligence, as well as the challenges faced by the New York City subway due to flooding. The episode concludes with a discussion on wireless charging technology for electric vehicles and its potential to revolutionize transportation.
