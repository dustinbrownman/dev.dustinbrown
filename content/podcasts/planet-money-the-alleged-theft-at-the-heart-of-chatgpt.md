## Summary

In this episode of the Planet Money podcast, bestselling thriller writer Douglas Preston explores the potential copyright infringement committed by OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT. Preston discovered that the AI chatbot had extensive knowledge of his books, including detailed plot summaries and descriptions of minor characters. He and 16 other authors, including George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult, believed that OpenAI had used their novels to train the AI without permission and filed a lawsuit in September. The podcast delves into the legal and ethical questions surrounding the use of copyrighted material to train AI and discusses previous cases involving Google and Spotify. While the outcome of the lawsuit remains uncertain, it is likely that OpenAI will seek a settlement with the authors rather than go to trial.

## Highlights

- **The Power of AI Chatbots:** Douglas Preston discovered that OpenAI's chatbot, Chat GPT, had an uncanny knowledge of the books he had written, including details about characters, settings, and plotlines. This raised questions about how the AI had acquired this information and whether it had used copyrighted material without permission.
- **Legal Concerns and Class Action Lawsuits:** Authors, including Douglas Preston and George R.R. Martin, have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming copyright infringement on an industrial scale. This case raises important questions about fair use and the boundaries of AI technology's access to copyrighted material. Similar lawsuits in the past have resulted in negotiated settlements rather than full trials, suggesting a potential resolution for this case as well.
