## Summary

In this episode of the Planet Money podcast, hosts Jeff Guo and Nick Fountain explore the persistence of pagers in the medical field. Despite being largely obsolete in other industries since the advent of cell phones, pagers remain the backbone of communication among medical doctors in many hospitals. The hosts follow the story of two doctors, Mary Mercer and Toff Christopher, who set out to rid their hospital of pagers and replace them with a more efficient texting app. However, their efforts faced unexpected resistance from both their colleagues and the culture that had developed around pagers. The episode delves into the complex factors that contribute to the difficulty of replacing seemingly outdated technologies, including risk, habit, identity, and power dynamics within an organization. Ultimately, the project to eliminate pagers in the hospital was not successful, highlighting the challenges of implementing new technology and the need to address drawbacks and cultural shifts alongside technological advancements.
