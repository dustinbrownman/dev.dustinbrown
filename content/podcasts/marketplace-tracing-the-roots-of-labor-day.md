## Highlights

- **Highlight 1: Women's labor force participation**  
Historically, women have participated in the labor force at lower rates than men. But in August, the gap shrank to just 10 and a half percentage points, the narrowest it's ever been. This is a significant development as job losses and disruptions during the pandemic hit women workers harder.

- **Highlight 2: The rise of leisure and hospitality employment**  
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says employment in the leisure and hospitality sector continued to grow in August. Employers are differentiating themselves by conveying a bigger purpose, aiming to be an important part of the community and not just exploit cheap labor. The recovery in this sector has been slow, but it is getting better.
