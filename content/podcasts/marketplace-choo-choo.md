## Summary

The Biden administration has announced an investment of $8 billion towards expanding the U.S. rail system, with a focus on high-speed rail. While train travel is common in parts of Europe and Asia, the U.S. has been slower to build high-speed rail. The expansion of rail systems is seen as a more climate-friendly alternative to flying or driving. In other news, Amazon is introducing an Amazon Fresh subscription service for its Prime members, offering unlimited free grocery delivery for a monthly fee. Additionally, part-time workers seeking full-time employment have seen an improvement in their job prospects, with a decrease in the number of workers in this category. The labor market is becoming more stable, and the strong jobs report is expected to keep the Federal Reserve in its current posture. Overall, the focus is on maintaining stable growth and keeping inflation under control.
