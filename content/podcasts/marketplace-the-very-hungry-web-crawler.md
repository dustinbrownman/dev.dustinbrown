## Summary

The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using the newspaper's content to train ChatGPT, an AI chatbot. This lawsuit raises questions about copyright law and the fair use doctrine. The practice at the center of these lawsuits is data scraping, where large amounts of data are ingested from the internet. This data is used to train AI models, but it raises concerns about copyright infringement. Additionally, credit unions are profiting from overdraft fees, which is a burden for customers. Black Americans are moving south to escape pollution, reminiscent of the reverse Great Migration. And student loan borrowers are struggling to resume repayment after a pandemic-era pause.

## Highlights

- **Tangled Legal Web with AI and Copyright:** Tech companies are facing lawsuits for allegedly violating copyright law by training AI models on content without permission or compensation, raising questions about fair use and the commercial nature of AI companies. *(Transcript excerpt: "As you've probably heard by now, the New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly copying and regurgitating its content via chat GPT, a product, the paper says, is now acting as a competitor.")*
- **Challenges of Resuming Federal Student Loan Payments:** More than a third of borrowers who had payments due in October hadn't made them by mid-November, highlighting the messy process of resuming federal student loan payments after the pandemic-era three-year pause. *(Transcript excerpt: "Another challenge, an estimated 40% of borrowers are working with new loan servicers. That's because a number of servicers left the industry in the past few years.")*
- **Sibling Duo Building a Native Design Business:** Rico and Crystal Wurl, the sibling duo behind Trickster Company in Juneau, Alaska, talk about the challenges and growth of their native design business and their plans for franchising. *(Transcript excerpt: "So there's a lot of moving parts in figuring out franchising.
