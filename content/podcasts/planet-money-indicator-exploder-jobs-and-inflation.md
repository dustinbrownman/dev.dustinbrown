## Highlights

- **Inflation: Measuring the Rise in Prices:** Inflation is a key indicator for any economy, and it's measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the price of everything we buy. The process of calculating CPI involves meticulous data collection by hundreds of workers and is kept top secret. (Transcript: paragraphs 4-7)
- **Jobs Growth and the Establishment Survey:** The monthly jobs report, which provides the number of jobs added to the economy, is generated through two main surveys: one that surveys households for unemployment data and another that surveys businesses and government agencies. The Establishment Survey, which interviews around 130,000 employers, is where the jobs numbers come from and is conducted through phone calls and online forms. (Transcript: paragraphs 40-55)
