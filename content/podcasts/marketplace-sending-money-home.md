## Highlights

- **Surging Housing Starts in November** - Despite predictions of a decline, new housing starts in November surged nearly 15%, surpassing expectations and indicating a positive trend in the housing market. This growth in the midst of higher mortgage rates shows the resilience of the housing sector.
- **Remittances on the Rise** - Remittances sent by expat workers around the world have seen significant increases, with low and middle-income countries experiencing a 4% growth. The surge in remittances has helped support local economies and countries, making them a vital source of income around the globe.
