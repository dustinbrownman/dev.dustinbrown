## Summary

In this episode, the hosts discuss the ongoing writers' strike in Hollywood and the existence of neutral gates at studio lots. These gates are entrances for non-striking productions, such as game shows and commercials, allowing them to bypass the picket lines. However, there are concerns that some productions may be taking advantage of these gates and using them when they shouldn't be. The hosts follow the story of Bill Wolkoff, a strike captain, who becomes determined to prove that one specific TV show, "The Young and the Restless," is cheating by using the neutral gate. With the help of a former writer from the show, they gather evidence and successfully get the gate flipped, making it a picketable area. This victory, although small, is seen as a step forward in the larger battle between the unions and studios.
