## Summary

In this podcast episode, the main topics discussed include inflation, Exxon's investment in West Texas, used car prices, and the demand for premium economy airline seats. The podcast begins by addressing the stable inflation rate and the uncertainty surrounding future inflation. Economists suggest that inflation has been stagnant due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic and the slow recovery of consumer spending and work habits. The worry is that prolonged high inflation could undermine the progress made by the Federal Reserve. In the second segment, the decreasing prices of used cars are highlighted, but it is noted that prices are still high for many buyers due to a shortage of supply. Finally, it is mentioned that airlines are experiencing increased earnings due to the demand for premium economy seats, as passengers are willing to pay for more space and comfort. Overall, these topics provide insights into the current economic trends and challenges in various sectors.

## Highlights

- **The Appeal of the Permian Basin:** The Permian Basin in West Texas is a highly attractive oil-producing region, accounting for 40% of all American oil production. Companies like Pioneer Natural Resources have seen success due to low production costs and the ability to quickly scale activity depending on market conditions. Additionally, investing in the Permian offers potential benefits for national security, as it reduces dependence on foreign oil. (Source: Marketplace)

- **Premium Economy Travel:** The travel industry has seen a growing market for premium economy seats, which offer passengers more space and amenities without the high price tag of business or first class. As people continue to prioritize comfort and safety while traveling, airlines are capitalizing on the demand for a middle-ground option between coach and premium classes. This trend has been especially prevalent as basic economy seats become more bare bones, making the upgrade to premium economy a more attractive option for many travelers. (Source: Marketplace)

- **College Student Concierge Services:** Services that offer concierge-style assistance to college students and their parents have emerged as a growing business opportunity. These services provide local parents who are familiar with the area with the ability to assist out-of-town parents with various needs, such as recommendations for restaurants or finding urgent care facilities. By paying for this service, parents can access a network of local knowledge and support, relieving some of the stress and uncertainty that comes with having a child attending college far from home.
