## Highlights

- **Tough Times in the Housing Market:** Mortgage rates are the highest they've been since 2000, making it difficult for buyers and builders alike. The increase in long-term interest rates is driving up construction costs and making it expensive to build new homes. [^1^]

- **Water and Development in Phoenix:** The rapid growth in Maricopa County, Arizona has led to a water shortage that is impacting development in and around Phoenix. The city of Buckeye, a suburb of Phoenix, is desperate to find new supplies of water to support its growing population. Investors, like Water Asset Management, are buying up farmland for water rights to sell to thirsty cities like Buckeye. [^2^]

- **Recruiting Young People to the Water Industry:** The water industry is facing a labor shortage as older workers retire, so initiatives are being launched to recruit high schoolers for water-related jobs. Some states, like Texas, are allowing high schoolers to get provisional licenses for these jobs, while others are creating specialized courses at community colleges. A robust water workforce is crucial to ensure water security, especially in states like Texas with aging infrastructure and growing populations. [^3^]
