## Summary

In this podcast episode, hosts Jeff Cannata and Anthony Carboni explore the relationship between personality traits and intelligence. They discuss a groundbreaking study that analyzed over 1,300 studies and found reliable connections between personality traits and cognitive abilities. The hosts touch on common stereotypes, such as the absent-minded genius or the idea that intelligent people are socially awkward. However, the study challenges these assumptions and reveals that openness, one of the big five personality traits, is the most reliably associated with intelligence. Additionally, the study shows that neuroticism and agreeableness have negative or negligible relationships with intelligence, and conscientiousness and extraversion have mixed results. The hosts mention the importance of being open-minded and compassionate, which are traits often associated with intelligence. They also consider factors such as acquired skills and innate abilities that contribute to intelligence and personality traits. While the study does not delve into the reasons behind these correlations, it suggests possibilities such as engaging in enriching activities or the effects of overall well-being. The hosts conclude that the study provides valuable insights into understanding oneself and making important life choices, such as career paths and relationships.

## Highlights

- **The Relationship Between Openness and Intelligence:** The study found a strong correlation between openness and intelligence, suggesting that individuals who are open-minded and willing to engage with new ideas and experiences tend to have higher levels of intelligence.
- **The Impact of Neuroticism on Intelligence:** The study revealed that higher levels of neuroticism predicted lower levels of intelligence. This challenges the notion that being moody or eccentric is a trait of high intelligence, suggesting that intelligence is not necessarily linked to negative emotions.
- **The Role of Agreeableness in Intelligence:** While agreeableness showed the weakest correlation with intelligence, facets such as compassion and interpersonal sensitivity were moderately strong predictors of general mental ability. However, politeness was negatively associated with cognitive ability, indicating that being agreeable does not necessarily equate to higher intelligence.

Overall, the study highlights the complex relationship between personality traits and intelligence, emphasizing the importance of factors such as openness, neuroticism, and agreeableness in understanding individual differences in cognitive abilities.
