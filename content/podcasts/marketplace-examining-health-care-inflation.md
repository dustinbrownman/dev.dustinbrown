## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss various topics related to the economy, including healthcare costs, corporate debt, and the finances of haunted houses. They mention that healthcare costs have contributed to inflation, and although the sector's price increases have lagged behind other industries, consumers and insurers are shelling out more for medication, nursing homes, and hospitals. The root cause of high healthcare spending is explored, as it is expected to make up a significant portion of the U.S. economy by 2030.

The episode also touches on the fear industry and the business of haunted houses, highlighting the different ways fear is presented as a product. Overall, the episode covers a range of economic and industry-related topics.
