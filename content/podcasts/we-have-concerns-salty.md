## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the hosts explore the mysteries of how our taste buds sense saltiness. They discuss the different receptors and proteins involved in detecting salt, including the ENaC sodium channel. Scientists have discovered that there are two types of salt receptors: one that signals when there is enough salt and one that triggers a negative response when there is too much salt. However, the exact location and mechanisms of the "too salty" response in our mouths remain unknown. The hosts also touch on the connection between salt and other tastes like sour and bitter. While there is still much to learn about salt sensation, the research is shedding light on our complex relationship with salt and how it affects our perception of flavor. So, while we have some understanding of how we taste salt, there is still more to uncover.

## Highlights

- **The Yummy Salt:** Scientists have discovered that sodium ions outside taste bud cells can enter those cells using the three-part ENaC gateway, creating a delicious taste of salt on the tongue.
- **The Mysterious Icky Salt:** Researchers are still trying to unravel the mystery of why high salt levels trigger an icky reaction in the taste buds, and suspect it might be connected to sour and bitter taste cells.
