## Summary

In this episode, the US gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the second quarter is revised down to 2.1%, but there are signs of strength in the economy, particularly due to strong consumer spending. Consumer spending, which makes up around 70% of GDP, has been growing, contributing to the overall economic growth. Other factors contributing to GDP growth include state and local government spending and federal expenditures. China's domestic tourism has shown signs of recovery, with the number of trips and amount spent within China reaching 80% of pre-pandemic levels. In the technology sector, dating apps are introducing premium subscription services with higher prices, but also offering lower-cost options to attract more subscribers. Lastly, the solar panel industry is experiencing growth as solar capacity and shipments continue to rise, thanks to falling prices and government incentives.
