## Highlights

- **Return of the Business Meal:** The return of in-person business meals is causing some awkwardness as people adjust to networking and dining etiquette after a long period of remote work. It provides valuable face-to-face networking opportunities, but can also be challenging to navigate.

- **Moving Houses:** A family in Door County, Wisconsin found a creative solution to their housing needs by moving a 1930s cottage-style house onto their property from a local church. The house provided them with a mortgage-free home and the opportunity to pursue other ventures such as starting an organic farm.
