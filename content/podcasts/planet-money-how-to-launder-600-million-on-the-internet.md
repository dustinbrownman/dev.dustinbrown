## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the host tells the story of Erin Plante, a private detective specializing in tracking down stolen cryptocurrency. Erin receives a phone call in the middle of the night informing her that the online game Axie Infinity has been hacked and over $600 million worth of digital money has been stolen, making it the largest crypto heist in history. Erin's task is to find the stolen money and recover it, leading her on an 18-month-long investigation that takes her into the world of sophisticated digital money launderers. Along the way, she discovers evidence that points to North Korea's involvement in the hack, raising concerns of national security. Erin and her team work diligently to track the stolen funds, freeze them when possible, and recover as much money as they can. Ultimately, about 20% of the stolen funds are expected to be recovered, highlighting the challenges of tracking and retrieving stolen cryptocurrency in this rapidly evolving digital ecosystem.

## Highlights

- **The Biggest Crypto Heist in History:** In March 2022, hackers stole $600 million worth of crypto from the game Axie Infinity, leading to an 18-month-long investigation and a face-off against sophisticated digital money launderers.
- **The Rise of Crypto Mixers:** The hackers used crypto mixers, like Tornado Cash, to launder the stolen funds. These mixers scramble the money, making it difficult to trace, but investigators at Chainalysis have developed ways to reverse the mixing process and track the money.
- **North Korea's Involvement:** The heist bears the hallmarks of North Korean hacking operations, and it's estimated that they fund about half of their nuclear program through stolen crypto. The FBI and other agencies are working to freeze the stolen funds before they can be converted into real cash.
