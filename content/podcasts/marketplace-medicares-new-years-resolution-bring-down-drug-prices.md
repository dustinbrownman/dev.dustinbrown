## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss various economic trends and issues. They mention that the Inflation Reduction Act aims to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but there is concern about finding a balance that makes medication affordable without driving drug companies out of the Medicare market. They also touch on the decline in red wine consumption, particularly among young people in France, and the new OSHA rules that increase transparency in workplace safety incidents. Despite efforts to address high drug prices, Reuters reports that more than 500 drugs will see price increases in the new year, although some treatments for conditions like asthma, herpes, and diabetes will see prices drop. Overall, the hosts discuss economic trends and potential challenges moving forward.

## Highlights

- **The Changing Landscape of the French Wine Industry:** French winemakers are struggling to sell their wine as drinking habits change, particularly among young people who are drinking less and prefer white wine over red. Export sales have also been impacted by Brexit and import tariffs. This has led to vineyard owners receiving government support to dig up their vines and transition to producing other types of wines, such as white and rosé varieties. The evolution of the wine industry in France is necessary to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

- **The Impact of OSHA's New Workplace Safety Reporting Rule:** Starting January 1st, 2024, about 50,000 employers in hazardous industries will be required to provide more detailed reporting of workplace incidents to OSHA. This information will be published on OSHA's website to increase transparency and public accountability for workplace safety. The new rule aims to address the lack of information available to OSHA about hazardous workplaces and help companies recognize patterns and make improvements to prevent future incidents.
