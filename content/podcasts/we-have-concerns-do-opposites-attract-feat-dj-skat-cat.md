## Summary

In this episode, the hosts discuss a study that analyzed more than 130 traits to determine whether opposites attract in relationships. The study looked at factors such as political and religious attitudes, level of education, medical conditions, and more. The researchers found that, on average, partners are more likely to be similar in most traits rather than opposites. However, there were a few traits that showed a small negative correlation, such as morning people being attracted to night people, and a tendency to worry. The hosts speculate on why these correlations exist and suggest that people may be more aware of the differences in their relationships, even though they have many similarities. They also discuss how societal changes and technology, like online dating, may impact partner selection. Overall, the study highlights the complex nature of attraction and emphasizes the need for further research on the topic.

## Highlights

- **Opposites Attract:** The study found that partners are more likely to be similar in most traits, suggesting that the idea of opposites attracting is not supported by the data.

- **Morning Larks and Night Owls:** Surprisingly, the study found that morning people tend to be attracted to night people, challenging the common belief that people are attracted to those who have similar sleep patterns.

- **Tendency to Worry:** Another unexpected finding is that people with differing levels of worry are more likely to be attracted to each other. This could suggest that opposing perspectives on potential threats and challenges may complement each other in a relationship.
