## Summary

In this episode, Anthony and Jeff discuss the Recreational Fear Lab at Aarhus University in Denmark, which studies the effects of fear on the human psyche. The lab recently conducted an experiment where two volunteers shared their worst fears, and the scientists recreated them in a customized haunted house at an amusement park. The volunteers experienced extreme fear but ultimately found it enjoyable. The lab believes that engaging with recreational fear can have positive effects and help individuals overcome their fears. Overall, the experiment showed that facing fear can lead to personal growth and a sense of accomplishment.
