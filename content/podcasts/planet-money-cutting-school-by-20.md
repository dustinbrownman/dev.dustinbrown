## Summary

In this episode of Planet Money, the podcast explores the growing trend of school districts switching to a four-day school week as a way to attract and retain teachers. The episode discusses the experiences of several districts, including the Warren County R3 school district in Missouri, where the superintendent, Greg Klingensmith, struggled to keep teachers due to low pay. To address this problem, the district decided to implement a four-day school week, allowing teachers to have three-day weekends while maintaining their salary. However, the decision to switch to a four-day week raises concerns about the impact on students. Research suggests that student achievement may be negatively affected, and there are also potential costs in terms of increased juvenile crime and poorer nutrition for students. The episode highlights the need for school districts to carefully consider the trade-offs involved in implementing a four-day school week and to ensure that adequate instruction time is maintained.

## Highlights

- **Teacher Retention Crisis:** Warren County R3 school district in Missouri faced a significant problem of losing teachers, with 20% of the teaching staff leaving each year due to low pay compared to neighboring districts.
- **Innovative Solution:** To retain teachers, the district implemented a four-day school week, allowing teachers to have a three-day weekend while maintaining their full salary, becoming part of a national trend of districts moving to shorter school weeks.
- **Impact on Students:** Research shows that the four-day school week has mixed effects on students. While it can lead to lower student achievement and negative social impacts like increased juvenile crime and poorer nutrition, maintaining a minimum of 31 hours of instruction per week can mitigate these effects.
