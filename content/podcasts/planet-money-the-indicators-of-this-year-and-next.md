## Summary

In this episode, the hosts of Planet Money and The Indicator engage in a friendly competition to determine the economic indicators of 2023 and 2024. They present their arguments for what they believe will define each year and invite listeners to vote for the best indicators. For 2023, Jeff Guo argues that the soft landing, specifically the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation without triggering a recession, will be the main storyline of the year. Kenny Malone suggests that consumer sentiment, which had a disconnect with positive economic numbers, will shape the upcoming elections and policy decisions. Wailin Wong contends that the lousy housing market, with slow movement and high mortgage rates, will be the best indicator. For 2024, Kenny predicts that interest rates and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's decisions will be the top indicator. Jeff argues that Bidenomics, including the implementation of industrial policy and big spending programs, will shape the economy and elections. Wailin believes that cracking down on junk fees, including surprise charges and hidden costs, will have a significant impact on consumers. Listeners are encouraged to vote for their favorite indicators.

## Highlights

- **Highlight 1: Indicator of 2023 - Saga of the Soft Landing**
In 2023, the main storyline was the saga of the soft landing, where the question was whether the Fed would be able to bring down inflation without triggering a recession. This kept everyone in suspense the whole year and felt like a rom-com between the Fed and the idea of a soft landing.

- **Highlight 2: Indicator of 2023 - Negative Consumer Sentiment**
2023 saw a disconnect between good economic numbers and bad economic sentiment, which was driven by people's feelings about the economy rather than the actual economic data. This disconnect could have a significant impact on elections and policymakers' decisions in the coming years.

- **Highlight 3: Indicator of 2024 - Junk Fees**
The Biden administration is going after surprise fees, otherwise known as junk fees, that get tacked onto various products and services. Proposed rules aim to reduce these fees and provide consumers with lower late fees or fewer add-ons, potentially saving billions of dollars.
