## Highlights

- **The Challenge of Talking about the Economy without Mentioning the Federal Reserve:** Marketplace host Kyle Rizdal and his guests discuss the difficulty of discussing the economy without mentioning the Federal Reserve or Jay Powell. The markets have not been responding to the Fed's statements about keeping rates high, leading to a lack of trust and belief in the central bank's messaging.

- **The Disconnect Between Consumer Sentiment and Consumer Spending:** Despite a growing economy and low unemployment rates, consumer sentiment has been declining, leading to a new six-month low. The high prices of goods and cost fatigue are contributing to this disconnect between how consumers feel and how they spend.

- **Transfer Students Facing Challenges:** Transfer students between community colleges and four-year universities face difficulties in transferring credits and planning their educational paths. On average, transfer students lose more than 40% of their credits when transitioning between schools, leading to increased time and costs for students.
