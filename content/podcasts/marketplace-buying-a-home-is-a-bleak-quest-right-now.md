## Summary

In this episode, the podcast discusses several economic topics. Firstly, it highlights the rough time for homebuyers due to steep home prices and climbing mortgage rates. The average monthly payment on new mortgages rose by 46% in 2022. Additionally, the podcast discusses the recovery of downtown cores in Texas cities and how they are bouncing back at different rates. Finally, there is a focus on the decline in demand for temp workers and how it may not be a reliable indicator of the overall economy.

## Highlights

- **Labor market returning to pre-pandemic normal:** Many metrics of the job market, such as the unemployment rate, job growth, and wage growth, are approaching pre-pandemic levels, indicating a return to a good normal. *(From the podcast transcript - "We have very low black unemployment. So there are many metrics that look very much like 2019 and even better. I think we're pretty close to what I'd consider to be a good normal.")*

- **The rising popularity of temporary help services:** Temp workers are in high demand, providing flexibility and variety in their job options. The temporary help services industry has expanded in recent years as companies outsource certain roles and tasks to temporary workers on an as-needed basis. *(From the podcast transcript - "For some jobs, she's hired directly, but others are through a temp agency, which calls her on the behalf of other companies.")*

- **Chicken prices at record highs:** Chicken prices at grocery stores have reached record highs, leading to increased margins for big chicken producers. While avian flu is a factor, the high prices are also a result of reduced production by big chicken companies. *(From the podcast transcript - "Chicken prices at grocery stores are at record highs and will probably stay there as big chicken cuts back on production to keep and increase their margins.")*
