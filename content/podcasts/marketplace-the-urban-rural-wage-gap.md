## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss several topics related to the economy. They start by discussing the urban-rural wage gap, which has been widening in recent years. Factors such as inflation, telework, and higher education contribute to this disparity. The hosts then discuss how more older Americans are still paying off their mortgages, which is a change from previous generations. They explore the reasons behind this trend, including refinancing, rising home prices, and increasing debt among older individuals. Lastly, they touch on the decline in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, with more funds being closed than opened. The lack of standardization and the potential for greenwashing have contributed to this decline.
