## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss the current state of the housing market and the impact of high home prices and mortgage rates. The Case-Shiller Home Price Index has reached an all-time high in July, while mortgage rates are above 7%. This unusual pairing is changing the dynamics between buyers and sellers, as buyers are faced with high costs and sellers are reluctant to accept lower offers. The episode also mentions that combating climate change will require trillions of dollars in investment, the 20th anniversary of the pumpkin spice latte, and the influence of gas prices on consumer sentiment. Overall, the podcast highlights the complexities of the housing market and the economic factors that contribute to it.
