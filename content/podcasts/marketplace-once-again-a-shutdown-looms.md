## Highlights

- **Changes to Consumer Price Index Calculation:** The Bureau of Labor Statistics is changing how it calculates the consumer price index (CPI) to better reflect health insurance costs, which have been fluctuating due to factors such as delayed elective care during the pandemic. The new calculation will provide a smoother measure and make the stats more meaningful in the long run.

- **Concerns Over Government Shutdown:** Time is running out for Congress to pass legislation to keep funding the federal government and avoid a shutdown. While essential services and mandatory programs would continue, hundreds of thousands of federal workers could be furloughed or have to work without pay.

- **Challenges in the Transition to Clean Energy Jobs:** The United Auto Workers (UAW) has been negotiating with automakers to ensure that workers in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) are protected and have rights similar to those in traditional auto manufacturing jobs. The transition from carbon-intensive jobs to greener jobs can be challenging, and efforts are needed to provide training, support, and job opportunities in areas where these transitions are taking place.
