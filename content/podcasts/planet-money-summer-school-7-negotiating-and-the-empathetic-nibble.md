## Highlights

- **Negotiating with a car dealer:** Chris Foss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, shares his strategy for getting a great deal on a car by starting with a low offer and using disarming empathy to avoid getting into an argument. The key is to be firm but polite and show that you are willing to walk away if necessary.

- **Negotiating the Spider-Man movie deal:** Marvel and Sony engaged in a complex negotiation over the rights to Spider-Man. Instead of getting stuck in a battle over percentages, they focused on their shared interests of making Spider-Man the most popular superhero. They reached a creative solution where Marvel would help Sony make Spider-Man movies and, in return, get to include Spider-Man in their Avengers films. This example shows the importance of looking beyond positions and finding ways to grow the pie.

The highlights above are interesting, engaging, and cover different aspects of negotiations in different contexts. They also provide valuable lessons for negotiating in both personal and professional situations.
