## Summary

In this episode of the podcast "The Indicator" from Planet Money, two topics related to food and drink are discussed. 

The first segment explores how economic conditions and inflation have led to fish and chips, a staple comfort food in the UK, becoming a luxury item. Rising energy prices and interest rates have increased the cost of running fish and chip shops, resulting in fewer people buying this traditional dish and the closure of many fish and chip shops across the country.

The second segment tells the story of Fabiola Pi√±aque, an indigenous woman in Colombia who received a cease and desist letter from Coca-Cola for using the term "Coca" in her company name, Coca-Nasa. Fabiola fought back, questioning who gave Coca-Cola permission to use the term "Coca." The dispute highlights the clash between trademark rights and the cultural significance of the Coca leaf to indigenous communities. The issue reached a stalemate, with both Coca-Cola and Coca-Nasa remaining on the market in Colombia. Fabiola's defiance and determination to continue her business despite persecution is evident.

Overall, these segments highlight the economic impact on food and the cultural clashes surrounding food-related issues.
