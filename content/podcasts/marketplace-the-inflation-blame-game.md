## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the host discusses the impact of still-high prices on consumers psychologically. Despite concerns about inflation causing consumers to pull back on spending, preliminary data shows that retail sales were actually up during the holiday season. Higher prices can make consumers more tolerant of the increased costs, but tolerance varies depending on income level. The episode also covers the iron ore market, which affects steel prices globally, and the car market, which is expected to level out in the coming year. Additionally, the podcast delves into the issue of toy clutter and how families are dealing with the excess of toys. Finally, the episode explores the European Union's efforts to establish a simpler and more accurate grading system for eco-labels on food products.

## Highlights

- **Retail Sales Remain Strong Despite Inflation:** Preliminary data shows that retail sales were up more than 3% from November 1st to Christmas Eve, with a larger increase in online sales compared to in-store purchases, despite concerns about inflation affecting consumer spending.
- **The Impact of Inflation on Consumer Behavior:** Inflation has made consumers more tolerant of higher prices, according to rice University professor Utpal Dallakia. However, the impact of higher prices varies depending on individuals' income levels.
- **Iron Ore Prices on the Rise:** The price of iron ore has increased nearly 39% over the past year, driven by demand from China and government stimulus measures. The rally in prices may be fueled by speculation rather than actual supply and demand dynamics.
