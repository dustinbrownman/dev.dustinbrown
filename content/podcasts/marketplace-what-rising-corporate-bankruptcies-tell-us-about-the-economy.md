## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss various topics related to the economy and the energy industry. They start by talking about the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and inflation. The Fed wants to keep its options open and remain data-dependent to react to any surprises in the economy. They also discuss the increase in corporate bankruptcies and its implications for the economy. The hosts then shift their focus to tariffs and trade relations, particularly between the US, China, and the European Union. They mention the potential for a longer-term solution to the trade disputes that could target China. Finally, they discuss the energy transition in Houston and the growing interest in sustainable energy, particularly in geothermal technology. Overall, the podcast touches on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, the state of the labor market, and the shift towards clean energy.

- **Young Workers Struggling in the Labor Market**: The labor market slowdown is hitting young workers, particularly those with no more than a high school diploma, the hardest. Employment levels for this group have declined by about 5%, highlighting the challenges they face in finding and keeping jobs. This trend has long-term implications for their economic mobility and prospects. [Listen here](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/friday-september-8-2023/).

- **Rents Stabilizing Amid Increase in Rental Units**: The rental market is starting to stabilize as the number of rental units being built in the US reaches a 50-year high. Rents in August this year were only slightly higher than the previous year, a significant decrease from double-digit annual increases seen before. This offers some hope for renters who have been burdened by rising housing costs. [Listen here](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/friday-september-8-2023/).
