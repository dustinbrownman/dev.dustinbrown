## Highlights

- **Resilience in the labor market:** Despite economic headwinds, the US labor market has remained resilient, with fewer people losing their jobs and businesses holding on to talent. This suggests positive economic cycles that help prevent recessionary signals.
- **Impact of government data shutdown:** During government shutdowns, important economic data collected by federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau is disrupted. This information is crucial for the Federal Reserve to make informed monetary policy decisions, and without it, the Fed may be uncomfortable making rate hike decisions.
- **Political TV ad costs:** Political TV ad costs can vary significantly depending on whether they are from official campaigns or outside groups. Official campaigns are afforded the lowest unit rate, while other groups have to pay the market rate. This discrepancy can result in higher costs for outside groups trying to reach the same audience.
