## Summary

In this episode, Jeff and Anthony discuss a study that involves tickling rats and playing games with them to understand the neural basis of play and laughter in mammals. The researchers found that tickling rats and playing games with them activated a section of the brain called the periaqueductal gray, which is associated with vocalization, fight-or-flight response, and pain modulation. The study suggests that play is instinctual and hardwired into the brain. The researchers hope that further research into play will help highlight the importance of positive experiences in our lives. Overall, it was a light-hearted and fun discussion about the study and the joy of play.
