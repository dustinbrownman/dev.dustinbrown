## Summary

In this podcast episode, sociologist Reuben Jonathan Miller discusses the economic effects and challenges faced by formerly incarcerated individuals. He shares personal experiences of trying to find housing and employment for his own brother after his release from prison. Miller emphasizes the importance of providing support and opportunities for individuals with criminal records, particularly those charged with violent crimes. He also highlights the need for society to move away from fear-based responses and instead focus on inclusion and giving people a chance to thrive.
