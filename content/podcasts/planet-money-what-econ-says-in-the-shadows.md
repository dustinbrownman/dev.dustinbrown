## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss the problematic online forum called Economics Job Market Rumors (EJMR). EJMR is known for its anonymous posts which often include racist and sexist content. Last year, economist Florian Ederer and engineer Kyle Jensen discovered a flaw in the site's anonymity, allowing them to identify the sources of the toxic posts. Their findings revealed that the toxic behavior on EJMR came from various universities and institutions, including top-ranked ones. Florian and his colleagues presented their research, causing panic among the users of the site. However, no official action has been taken by the universities implicated. Florian believes that while exposing the worst actors on the platform may be beneficial, he is wary of veering into doxing territory. The episode explores the trade-offs of anonymity and the need for a better way for economics to address its toxic behavior.

- **Florian and his colleagues were able to de-anonymize posters on the site by using statistical analysis and IP addresses.** Although they chose not to reveal individual posters' identities, their research highlights the potential risks of posting anonymously online and the need for better communication within the field of economics.
