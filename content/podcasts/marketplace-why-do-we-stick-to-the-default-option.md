## Summary

The podcast discusses the psychology of defaults and their power in influencing consumer behavior. It focuses on Google's role as the default search engine and the antitrust trial against the company. The Justice Department argues that Google's default status on various devices gives it an unfair advantage over competitors. The podcast also touches on the revenue side of the budget deficit and the impact of over-employment, where individuals work multiple jobs simultaneously. The phenomenon of over-employment is driven by a desire for financial security and control over one's work.

## Highlights

- **Tech companies and default settings:** Default settings have always been powerful, even when they don't make sense, and can create consumer inertia. Google pays billions of dollars annually for default status, locking out competitors. ([source](https://www.marketplace.org/2023/10/23/the-power-of-defaults-on-search-engines-and-more))
- **The debate on CEO pay:** The debate on CEO pay continues to grow, with concerns over the disproportionate amounts being earned. Some believe that CEO compensation ratios should be closer to 20 to 1, rather than the current ratios that can exceed 5,000 to 1.
