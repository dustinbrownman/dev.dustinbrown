## Highlights

- **Small Business Roller Coaster:** Patchworks, a music store specializing in synthesizers and electronic instruments, experienced a surge in sales during the pandemic as people looked for ways to bring joy and learn new instruments at home. However, demand has since eroded, leading to reduced hours, staff layoffs, and budget cuts.
- **Surviving the Mega Drought:** In the face of an ongoing mega drought in the American Southwest, residents of Rio Verde Foothills, Arizona, experienced months without affordable running water. They relied on hauled water, but faced increased costs and limited availability due to changes in water supply policies. This led to challenges in daily living and forced them to adapt by collecting rainwater and making lifestyle adjustments.
- **AI in Hollywood:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its mark in the entertainment industry, offering solutions for dubbing, CGI production, and script analysis. Companies like Flawless and Wonder Dynamics are utilizing AI to improve lip synchronization in foreign language dubbing and create CGI graphics more efficiently and affordably. Storyfit uses AI to analyze scripts in detail, identifying areas for improvement and predicting audience reactions. These AI tools serve as aids for filmmakers without replacing human creativity and expertise.
