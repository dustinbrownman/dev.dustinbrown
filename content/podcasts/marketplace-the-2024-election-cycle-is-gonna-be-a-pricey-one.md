## Summary

In this podcast episode, several topics are discussed. Firstly, the 2023-24 US election cycle is predicted to be the most expensive ever, with over $10 billion expected to be spent across various platforms. The sources of this funding and the potential financial race are explored. Secondly, the holiday shopping season is coming to a close, and retailers are looking for ways to extend it. Post-holiday sales and optimizing leftover inventory are common strategies. However, retailers need to be cautious about how they approach promotions and messaging, as consumers may be fatigued from the numerous promotions they have already received. Thirdly, the podcast discusses the predictions for streaming services in 2024. Prices for streaming platforms may increase, and there may be more bundled subscriptions. Advertising on streaming platforms is also expected to grow. Lastly, the housing market is discussed, with home prices continuing to rise while rent inflation is slowing down. The challenges for potential home buyers and the possible relief in the rental market are explored. The podcast also includes a segment on worker organizing at ski resorts and an interview about running a family-owned quilt shop.

## Highlights

- **Post-Holiday Sales Push**: After the holiday shopping season, retailers are trying to optimize their leftover inventory with end-of-year sales, encouraging customers to use gift cards and buy items for their New Year resolutions.
- **Record-High Outside Spending in Election Season**: Total outside spending in the 2024 campaign season is already double the previous record for this point in the cycle, with super PACs and political nonprofits playing a significant role.
- **Streaming Platforms Increasing Prices**: Streaming platforms are raising subscription prices and introducing advertisements to boost profit margins, partly due to the saturation of the market and the need to cover rising content costs.
