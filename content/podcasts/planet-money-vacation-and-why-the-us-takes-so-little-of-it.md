## Highlights

- **Highlight 1:** In Europe, workers in the richest countries are guaranteed paid vacation, while the U.S. is the outlier with zero paid vacation days by law.
- **Highlight 2:** The U.S. didn't prioritize guaranteed paid vacation because unions focused on bargaining for pension benefits and health insurance instead.
- **Highlight 3:** Talking about vacation can help change the culture of overworking in the U.S. and encourage bosses to promote and workers to take more time off.
