## Highlights

- **Inflation Slows and Fed May Halt Rate Hikes:** The consumer price index and core inflation both slowed in October, indicating that the Federal Reserve may halt their efforts to cool inflation by raising interest rates. This could provide relief at the checkout for consumers.
- **Airline Prices Drop:** Airfares have dropped by 13% compared to last year, as airlines have added back seat capacity and demand has leveled out. This is leading to more competition among airlines and lower prices for customers.
- **Decline in Walking Trips:** A recent report shows that Americans are walking less, with an average decline of 36% in daily walking trips since 2019. This could have implications for public health and efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
