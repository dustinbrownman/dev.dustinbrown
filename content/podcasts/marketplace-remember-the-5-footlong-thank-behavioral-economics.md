## Highlights

- **Inflation and Fed Policy:** Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's recent speech emphasized the central bank's commitment to bringing down inflation, with Powell stating, "We will keep at it until the job is done." This signals the Fed's focus on maintaining a 2% inflation target. (Transcript excerpt from "Marketplace Morning Report")

- **Semiconductor Workforce Shortage:** The semiconductor industry is projected to face a shortage of 67,000 engineers, technicians, and computer scientists by 2030. Efforts are being made to address this shortage through partnerships with universities and community colleges. (Transcript excerpt from "The HR of High Tech")

- **Reference Prices and Inflation:** Consumers are grappling with rising prices as inflation affects everyday purchases. The concept of reference prices, both external and internal, plays a role in consumers' perception of price increases. Internal reference prices are rooted in longstanding memories of low inflation, causing confusion and resentment when prices go up. (Transcript excerpt from "The Psychology of Rising Prices")
