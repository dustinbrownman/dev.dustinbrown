## Summary

In this podcast episode, several topics are covered. Firstly, it discusses the success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in providing health care coverage to millions of people through federal or state marketplaces. The generous subsidies for ACA plans in 2021 as part of pandemic relief programs contributed to the high enrollment numbers. Next, the episode highlights the lack of official government data on the "creator economy," which refers to the industry of online influencers, content creators, and social media personalities. Despite the significant presence of this industry and its impact on culture, politics, and business, there is a lack of information and labor protections for those working in this field. The episode also mentions the concept of hot desking, where office workers do not have assigned desks but instead share workstations, and explores its pros and cons. Finally, the podcast briefly touches on folk schools that teach traditional crafts and skills to students of all ages, as a response to the growing desire for hands-on experiences in an increasingly high-tech world.
