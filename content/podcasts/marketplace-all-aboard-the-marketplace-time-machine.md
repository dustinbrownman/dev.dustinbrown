## Highlights

- **Economic Whodunit**: The podcast discusses the unexpected lack of recession in the economy and explores what factors may have contributed to this outcome. (Transcript excerpt: "So, here we are at the end of a year during which there was almost literally a 100% expectation that we were going to have a recession. Somebody though forgot to tell the economy, and the question is what happened and who gets the credit?")
