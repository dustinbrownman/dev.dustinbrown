## Highlights

- **Record-breaking Harvest:** Despite facing a drought, April Hemas, a farmer in Iowa, achieved a record-breaking harvest, beating her corn yield by 10 bushels an acre and her soybeans by five.
- **Labor Costs Cooling Off:** Wage growth is cooling off after the frenzied rate seen in 2020 and 2021, as employers find it easier to find and retain workers. However, certain industries, such as auto and fast food, are still seeing wage increases.
- **Union Victory for Home-based Childcare Providers:** In California, home-based childcare providers won big in their fight for better pay and benefits after forming a union. They now have access to state-funded healthcare, training, retirement benefits, and increased pay.
