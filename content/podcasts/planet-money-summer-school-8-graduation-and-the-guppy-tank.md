## Summary

In this episode of the Planet Money podcast, the hosts celebrate the graduation of the Planet Money Summer School Class of 2023. They combine graduation with a startup pitch competition similar to Shark Tank. Five listeners with real startup ideas pitch their businesses, and a business expert provides feedback on what investors look for in a pitch. The pitches include a celebrity book subscription service, an Uber for tour guides, a collapsible rain boot, a digital app for long-term planning, and a service that offers Viking funerals. After hearing all the pitches, the business expert chooses the winner, who is the founder of the celebrity book subscription service.
