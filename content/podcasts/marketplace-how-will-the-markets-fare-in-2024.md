## Highlights

- **Prospects for US financial markets in 2024:** Investment analysts have a range of opinions on the outlook for US financial markets in 2024, with some expressing unbridled bullishness and others cautious bearishness. However, there is agreement that the end of 2023 rallies still have room to run, and with the economy performing well and the Fed's rate hikes behind them, there is optimism for a positive year ahead.

- **Advancements in AI for assistive communication devices:** The development of AI-enabled augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices is revolutionizing the way people with non-standard speech, such as those with muscular dystrophy or recovering from a stroke, communicate. These devices, like Google's Project Relate, can help transcribe conversations in real-time and provide text-based communication support, improving accessibility and independence for individuals with speech impairments.

- **Impact of interest rates on borrowing decisions:** The uncertainty surrounding future interest rate cuts presents a conundrum for business owners considering borrowing money. While high interest rates have put pressure on budgets and led to slowdowns in sectors like housing construction, some businesses are choosing to wait for rates to fall before borrowing. Others, however, are seizing opportunities and taking loans to expand or invest in new projects, with the belief that the benefits outweigh the higher interest costs. (*Source: Marketplace*)
