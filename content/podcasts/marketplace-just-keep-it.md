The podcast then delves into the disconnect between people's negative perception of the economy and the positive economic data, highlighting factors such as higher prices and housing affordability as reasons for the discrepancy. Additionally, the podcast explores the concept of "return-less" refunds offered by major retailers, where customers are allowed to keep items they want to return instead of sending them back, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of this practice.

## Highlights

- **Soft Landing Still Uncertain:** Despite positive economic data, the mission of achieving a 2% inflation target has not been accomplished yet, and there are concerns that the last mile towards reaching the target will be challenging due to factors like housing, oil prices, and wages.
- **Disconnect Between Data and Perception:** People's negative perception of the economy does not align with the positive economic data, creating a significant disconnect. Factors like higher prices and housing affordability contribute to this general feeling of malaise.
- **Deals and Risks in Retail and Restaurant Industry:** Major retailers are offering keep-it return policies, allowing customers to keep items and avoid the expenses of returns, while restaurant chains are running flashy deals to stimulate sales and loyalty, despite potential risks such as decreasing profit margins and consumer expectations.
