## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host explores the issue of excess marijuana in the state of Oregon. Due to an oversupply of weed and a lack of buyers, large quantities of usable marijuana are being left in fields to rot. The state's strict regulations and federal laws prohibiting interstate trade pose significant challenges for the cannabis industry in Oregon. Matt Ochoa, the owner of Jefferson Packing House, wants to sell the surplus marijuana to other states where demand is higher. However, both Oregon state laws and federal laws prevent him from doing so. Ochoa has joined a lawsuit challenging the restrictions on interstate trade, arguing that the local laws infringe upon the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause. If successful, this legal battle could potentially open up opportunities for the marijuana industry in Oregon and other states.

## Highlights

- **The Glut of Weed in Oregon:** In Oregon, there is so much weed being grown that farmers are leaving perfectly good plants in the field to rot because there aren't enough buyers. This has led to a plummet in prices and a tough few years for marijuana farmers. 
- **Legal Challenges and Business Problems:** The tension between federal and state laws regarding the legality of marijuana creates unique business problems for entrepreneurs like Matt Acheola. Federal laws prevent him from accessing banking services, trademark protections, and interstate commerce opportunities. 
- **Challenging State Laws with the Dormant Commerce Clause:** Matt Acheola and his lawyer, Andrew Deweese, are suing the state of Oregon, arguing that their laws prohibiting the export of Oregon-grown marijuana violate the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. They believe that states should not be able to restrict interstate trade in marijuana, and if successful, this could open up opportunities for the marijuana industry to expand beyond state lines.
