## Summary

In this podcast episode, Jeff and Anthony discuss the unexpected side effect of climate change: the rapid growth and increased toxicity of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. They talk about personal experiences with these plants and the fact that only 80% of the population is allergic to them. The hosts mention Peter Baron, who works in poison ivy removal and has been documenting the growth of these plants over the years. They also mention scientific studies that simulated the effects of climate change on plants, which revealed that poison ivy grows faster and becomes more toxic in high carbon dioxide environments. The hosts speculate on the implications of this phenomenon, including an increase in hospitalizations due to severe poison ivy reactions. Overall, the episode highlights the surprising ways that climate change is impacting the world around us.
