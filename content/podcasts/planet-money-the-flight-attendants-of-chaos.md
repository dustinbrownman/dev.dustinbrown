## Summary

In this episode of the Planet Money podcast, the hosts discuss a labor dispute between Alaska Airlines and its flight attendants' union in 1993. The union, aware of the TWA strategy of permanently replacing striking flight attendants, devised a counter-strategy called CHAOS: "Create Havoc Around Our System." The union threatened to strike at any moment, keeping Alaska Airlines guessing and causing chaos in the airline's operations. While Alaska Airlines prepared to hire replacement workers, the intermittent striking tactic used by the flight attendants made it difficult for the airline to permanently replace them. The chaos strategy ultimately proved successful, leading to a favorable contract for the flight attendants and inspiring future labor strikes. The hosts draw parallels to the ongoing United Auto Workers strike and discuss the effectiveness of the chaos strategy in different types of labor disputes.
