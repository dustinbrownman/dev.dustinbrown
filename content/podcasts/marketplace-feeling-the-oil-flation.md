## Summary

In this podcast episode, several topics are discussed. Firstly, it is mentioned that oil prices are rising and may reach $100 a barrel soon, which will have ripple effects throughout the economy. The increase in oil prices will likely lead to higher gasoline prices, impacting discretionary spending and potentially affecting economic growth. Furthermore, the volatility of aircraft orders is explored, with large orders being clustered around industry events and manufacturers having long backlogs. This information provides insights into the broader economy. Additionally, the podcast touches upon the issue of transparency in college cost disclosures, as many colleges understate or do not provide clear information about the net price of attending. Finally, the episode concludes with a discussion about the rising prices of chocolate and the upcoming holidays, which are busy seasons for the chocolate industry.
