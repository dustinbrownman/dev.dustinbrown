## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts challenge the common belief that men were hunters and women were gatherers in early human societies. They discuss the history of the "man the hunter" theory and how it has been based on misconceptions and biases. They present evidence that shows men and women actually had more shared roles and responsibilities. For example, women were found to be hunters in some cultures and the idea that men were better suited for hunting due to physical strength is also questioned. The hosts emphasize the importance of looking at evolutionary and sociological differences between genders and challenging antiquated beliefs.
