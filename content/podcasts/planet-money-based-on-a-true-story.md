## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host explores the journey of one producer's quest to make a movie about the GameStop stock frenzy that took place in 2021. The producer, Aaron Ryder, saw the potential for a great movie in the story of amateur investors rallying around GameStop to take on Wall Street. However, he faced fierce competition from other movie producers and Hollywood studios who also saw the movie potential. Aaron found a book proposal by writer Ben Mesrick that focused on the GameStop phenomenon and quickly acquired the rights to it. He then assembled a team of screenwriters, a director, and a cast of A-list actors to speed up the movie production process. After facing a setback when the project was put on hold due to Amazon's acquisition of the studio, Aaron managed to negotiate a deal to regain control of the project and secured funding from Black Bear Pictures. The movie, titled "Dumb Money," is set to be the first GameStop feature film to hit theaters, highlighting the challenges and competitiveness of turning real-world events into box office gold.
