## Summary

In this episode of Planet Money, the hosts tackle the economics of Thanksgiving. They start off by exploring the mystery of why the price of turkeys actually goes down during the holiday season, despite the increased demand. They examine different theories, such as supermarkets using turkeys as loss leaders and customers being more price sensitive, but ultimately discover a new theory that suggests the increased competition among stores during the holidays drives down prices. The hosts also discuss the concept of home production and how it is not accounted for in traditional economic measurements like GDP. They explain that measuring home production is important for understanding the true state of the economy and give examples of how it can impact economic analyses. Lastly, the hosts use matching theory to solve the challenge of seating arrangements for their Thanksgiving feast, optimizing for stability rather than overall happiness. They go through the process of collecting preferences from their guests and simulating different seating arrangements to find the best solution. Despite some initial reservations from guests, they ultimately achieve a stable seating arrangement that maximizes everyone's satisfaction. Overall, the episode provides an interesting and informative look at the economic aspects of Thanksgiving.

## Highlights

- **The Thanksgiving Turkey Economic Mystery:** Every year during the holidays, the price of turkey goes down, even though demand for turkey spikes. Economists have different theories to explain this phenomenon, including loss leader pricing and price-sensitive customers. The mystery of why turkey prices drop during the holidays has intrigued economists for years.

- **Home Production and the Economy:** The time and effort spent on cooking, cleaning, and other household chores are not included in official measures of the economy, like GDP. However, economists have found that home production, like preparing a Thanksgiving feast, is a significant part of the economy and should be considered when measuring overall economic activity.

- **Optimizing the Thanksgiving Seating Arrangement:** The challenge of creating an optimal seating arrangement for Thanksgiving dinner can be tackled using matching theory. By considering everyone's preferences and optimizing for stability, economists can help find a seating arrangement that maximizes overall satisfaction.
