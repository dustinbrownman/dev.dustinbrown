## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host discusses the United Nations' climate change conference taking place in Dubai, where leaders and experts will discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the irony lies in the fact that Dubai heavily relies on fossil fuel exports and the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. is hosting the event. This potential conflict of interest raises questions about the progress towards renewable energy. Additionally, the podcast highlights a rise in hybrid and electric vehicle sales despite a slowdown in overall consumer spending during the third quarter.

## Highlights

- **Rising Demand for Electric Vehicles:** More people are buying electric vehicles as manufacturers offer a greater variety of makes and models, including SUVs, crossovers, and pickup trucks. The percentage of EV sales compared to all new light-duty vehicle sales has steadily increased from 8.5% in 2021 to 17.7% in the third quarter of 2022.

- **Manufacturing Medicines in Space:** Varta Space Industries, a company based in El Segundo, California, manufactures pharmaceuticals in space, taking advantage of the lack of gravity to create drug formulations that cannot be made on Earth. By changing gravity, they can alter chemical processes and create smaller crystals, allowing for different methods of drug administration. Varta's capsules hitch rides on missions to space and return to Earth in specially built reentry vehicles.
