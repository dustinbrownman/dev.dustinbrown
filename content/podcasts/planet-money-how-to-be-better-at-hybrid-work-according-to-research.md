## Summary

In this episode of Planet Money, economist Jose Maria Barrero discusses the challenges and benefits of remote work. Barrero reviews recent studies on the productivity of remote work and highlights the difficulties in measuring productivity for knowledge-based jobs. While earlier research suggested that fully remote work could be as productive or even more productive than working in the office, new evidence reveals that productivity may not be as positive for fully remote workers. The challenges of communication and collaboration in a remote setting, as well as limitations in idea generation, contribute to a decrease in productivity. However, Barrero emphasizes that hybrid work, which combines remote and in-person work, seems to be a more favorable option. Hybrid work allows for the benefits of remote work, such as reduced commutes and increased job satisfaction, while still maintaining the in-person interactions that are important for certain tasks. Barrero concludes that the pandemic has shifted the mindset around remote work and opened opportunities for new work arrangements that are more productive and flexible.

## Highlights

- **The Debate on Working from Home:** The podcast explores the ongoing debate on whether working from home is better or worse than working in the office, and highlights the challenges faced by employers and employees in measuring productivity in knowledge jobs that can be done remotely. 

- **Hybrid Work and Productivity:** The podcast discusses the findings of a recent study on hybrid work, which suggests that while fully remote work may have a negative effect on productivity, hybrid work, which combines in-person and remote work, may not result in a quantifiable productivity loss. The study also highlights the importance of effective management and coordination in a hybrid work setup.
