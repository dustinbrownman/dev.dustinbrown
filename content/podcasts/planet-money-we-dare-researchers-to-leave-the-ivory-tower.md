## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the hosts play a game of Never Have I Ever with two researchers, daring them to go out into the real world and experience something they have never done before. The first researcher, Darian, is taken to an Outback Steakhouse, where they investigate whether the restaurant truly serves as an economic melting pot. They find that people from diverse financial backgrounds do visit the restaurant and mingle with each other. The second researcher, Kevin, visits an 1830s historical village to ride in a horse-drawn trolley driven by a Teamster. This experience is tied to Kevin's research on how labor markets respond to the threat of disruptive technologies. By studying the historical decline of the Teamster occupation due to the rise of motorized trucks, Kevin and his colleagues discover that wages rise and older workers enter the industry before it eventually becomes obsolete. The episode emphasizes the need to consider the impact of technology on different occupations and the importance of planning for future job changes.

- **The Parallels Between Luddites and Modern Tech Critics:** The Luddites, who opposed new technologies during the Industrial Revolution, had a prescient social critique about the human costs of innovation, much like modern critics of AI and automation. (Timestamp: 12:14-18:02)

- **The Decline of Teamsters and the Rise of Automation:** By analyzing census data, researchers found that the Teamster labor market saw a decline and eventual obsolescence as motorized trucks replaced horse-drawn trucks, highlighting the potential impact of automation on certain industries.
