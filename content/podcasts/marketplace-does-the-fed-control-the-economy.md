## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss various economic factors that the Federal Reserve does not have direct control over, such as gas price fluctuation and stock market trends. They also analyze the recent jobs report, which showed 150,000 new jobs added and a slight increase in the unemployment rate. While the headline numbers look decent, there are underlying signs of vulnerability in the economy, such as a shrinking work week and downward revisions of job numbers. The hosts also discuss wage growth, which has slowed down, and the impact of consumer behavior on the economy. Overall, the podcast highlights the complex nature of financial conditions and the challenges the Federal Reserve faces in managing the economy. They also touch on school bus driver shortages and the adaptation of paper companies to paperless billing.

## Highlights

- **The Takeaway from the Federal Reserve perspective:** The numbers across the board, as Catherine mentioned, we saw a tick down in the work week. We saw a tick down in wage growth on a month-over-month basis. Those are the kinds of things the Fed has long been waiting to see. I think we saw markets react sort of in line with that. We saw them being pretty happy with these numbers. I think the takeaway here from sort of a monetary policy interest rates perspective is maybe this means there's a little less work to do there.

- **The Financial Conditions:** The Fed does not actually totally control financial conditions. It tries. It would probably love to, but it doesn't. Reality gets in the way. At the moment, for example, bank lending standards have been relatively tight for most of this year in the wake of the banking crisis that we had last spring. And so it is quite a bit harder for firms and individuals to get bank credit than it was 12 months ago. Fed didn't do that. And there's gas prices. They rise or fall, affecting people's budgets and willingness to borrow. Fed's got nothing to do with that either. Stock prices can rise or fall, making it easier or harder for some businesses to raise money. No Fed there. And long-term bond yields. These are what affect mortgages and car loans. They can rise or fall, and they are set by the bond market. And then all of a sudden you are getting more restrictive, effective monetary policy in the system, even though the Fed hasn't necessarily acted.
