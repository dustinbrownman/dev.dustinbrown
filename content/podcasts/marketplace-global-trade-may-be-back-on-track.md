## Highlights

- **New Home Sales Surge:** New home sales are up 18% from the previous year, marking the highest level in at least 40 years. The surge in new construction is driven by high mortgage rates, limited supply of existing homes, and attractive incentives offered by builders.
- **Malls Make a Comeback:** Despite predictions of their decline, shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence, with some outperforming their pre-pandemic performance. Malls are adapting to changing consumer preferences and offering a mix of retail, dining, and entertainment experiences to attract customers.
- **Changing Dynamics of Holiday Shopping:** Retailers are adopting new strategies for holiday discounting, shifting away from excessive discounts driven by excess inventory. They are focusing on targeted promotions, personalized offers, and enhancing the overall shopping experience to attract consumers.
