## Summary

In this episode, the podcast discusses the recent positive labor and retail data in the economy. Despite low unemployment, high job availability, and increased consumer spending, there are concerns about inflation. Excessively strong labor market data could lead to further inflationary pressures and potentially higher interest rates. However, there is some optimism that the economy may achieve a soft landing, where inflation comes down without a recession. In addition to this, the podcast highlights the growth of online shopping in the retail sector and the challenges that developing countries face with their debt. Lastly, the episode includes segments on the use of recycled wastewater for brewing beer and the importance of flood disclosure laws in real estate transactions.

## Highlights

- **Good news about the economy just good news?**: In an economy where inflation is a concern, positive labor market data can be seen as a sign of further inflationary pressures, according to economist Gregory Dacco.
- **Impact of online shopping**: Since COVID, customers have become more comfortable with online shopping and physical retail stores are now becoming showrooms, with e-commerce sites providing more variety, according to University of Houston professor Olivia Johnson.
- **Future of water resources**: With the ongoing mega drought and declining water resources, cities like Scottsdale are turning to direct potable reuse, where treated wastewater is sent directly into the drinking water supply, according to Brian Biesmeyer, Executive Director of Scottsdale Water.
