## Summary

In this podcast episode, economists reflect on the past year of the Federal Reserve's mission and summarize it in just one word. The word chosen by the Oxford English Dictionary for 2023 is "rizz," meaning charming and charismatic. The economists discuss the progress made in the economy, with strong growth moderating, a balanced labor market, and inflation making progress. They also discuss the potential for solar and wind power to surpass coal usage in the US next year. In another segment of the podcast, a California startup called Charger Help is highlighted, which aims to fix issues with electric vehicle charging stations. Lastly, the podcast mentions the increase in car insurance costs, particularly due to factors such as severe weather, the higher cost of repairing advanced car technology, and the aging population.
