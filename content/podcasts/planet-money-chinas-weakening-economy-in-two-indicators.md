## Highlights

- **China's Revenge Spending Theory**: The podcast discusses the theory of revenge spending in China, where people would start spending heavily after COVID restrictions were lifted. However, official statistics do not support this theory, and the podcast explores the real stories of people and their spending habits. 

- **Impact of No International Tourism on China's Economy**: The podcast highlights the significant drop in international tourists visiting China, which has had a negative impact on the economy. The number of tourists through travel agencies decreased by 99% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2019, affecting industries such as hospitality and retail. 

- **Youth Unemployment in China**: The podcast delves into the issue of youth unemployment in China, with the urban youth unemployment rate reaching 21%. The high competition for white-collar jobs, the pressure to work long hours, and the lack of household stimulus have contributed to this problem. The long-term consequences and social implications of youth unemployment are also discussed.
