## Summary

Saudi Arabia and Russia have announced that they will continue their oil production cuts through the end of the year, in an effort to boost oil prices. This decision has led to a surge in oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $87 a barrel earlier in the summer. Energy analysts believe that these production cuts will have a significant impact on oil prices, and could negatively affect the global economy if prices continue to rise. While Russia's commitment to the cuts is uncertain due to potential sanctions, Saudi Arabia has shown more market discipline and is trying to keep global crude prices up. In other news, over 800,000 people have benefited from student loan forgiveness in the United States, and there is a rise in "girl math" and other ways that people justify their enthusiastic spending.
