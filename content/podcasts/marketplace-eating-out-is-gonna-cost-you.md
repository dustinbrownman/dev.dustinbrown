## Summary

In this podcast episode, the main focus is on the rising costs in the restaurant industry and how it affects the prices of food away from home. The latest consumer price index shows that food inflation rates are higher for restaurant meals compared to groceries. The main factor contributing to this gap is the rising wages of restaurant staff, which make up a larger portion of a restaurant's revenue compared to grocery stores. The podcast features interviews with restaurant owners who discuss the challenges of balancing rising costs with keeping customers satisfied. Additionally, the episode covers other food-related topics such as the history of American diners and the increasing cost of ingredients like sugar.

## Highlights

- **Highlight 1: The Rising Cost of Eating Out**: The latest consumer price index shows that while the cost of food at home and away from home are increasing at a slower rate, inflation is much higher at restaurants than it is at grocery stores. (Source: Marketplace transcript)

- **Highlight 2: The Myth of the American Diner**: Politicians often visit diners to connect with working-class Americans, but diners have never really been a space where everyone is welcome. They have a history of racial and countercultural exclusivity. (Source: Marketplace transcript)
