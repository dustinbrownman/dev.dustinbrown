## Highlights

- **Highlight 1:** "The National Park Service wants to turn the original First Bank of the United States into a new museum of the American economy." The museum aims to tell the story of how the nation has been shaped by wealth, land ownership, and the economy of slavery.
- **Highlight 2:** "Retirement account balances are going back up again. The average balance at the end of June was about $112,000, 8 percent better than a year ago." This is due to a strong economy and more people saving for retirement through automatic enrollment in retirement plans.
