## Summary

In this podcast episode, Jeff and Anthony discuss new research that suggests applying the hero's journey narrative structure to one's own life can have profound effects. The hero's journey, first described by mythologist Joseph Campbell, consists of seven steps: protagonist, shift, quest, allies, challenge, transformation, and legacy. The researchers conducted four studies and found that when participants re-story their lives using the hero's journey framework, they experienced increased life satisfaction and decreased depression. It was discovered that both identifying the steps and telling the story were necessary for the intervention to be effective. By applying this framework, individuals can find meaning and motivation in their own lives and work towards their goals.
