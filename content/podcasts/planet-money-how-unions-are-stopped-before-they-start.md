## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the hosts explore the difficulties of setting up unions in the United States, using the example of the failed attempts to unionize the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The United Auto Workers (UAW) believed that they would be able to successfully unionize the plant since Volkswagen has worker representation at its plants around the world. However, they faced opposition from politicians and anti-union forces. The UAW tried different approaches, such as establishing a micro unit and organizing protests, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. The hosts discuss how timing, political affiliations, and external factors can greatly impact the outcome of union campaigns. Despite the obstacles, some workers remain determined to continue their fight for unionization.
