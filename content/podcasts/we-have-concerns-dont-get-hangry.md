## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts discuss the effects of calorie-restricting diets on mood. They acknowledge the growing popularity of diet trends like intermittent fasting and calorie restriction, but emphasize the lack of scientific evidence to support their long-term benefits. The hosts argue that calorie restriction can lead to negative emotions such as tension, anger, depression, fatigue, and confusion. They also mention that dieting, even in a healthy manner, can increase the likelihood of depression and anger. The hosts suggest that individuals should listen to their bodies and eat when they're truly hungry, rather than following restrictive diets. They highlight the importance of self-awareness and recognizing the physiological basis of emotions. The hosts also mention the impact of hunger on decision-making, citing a study that found parole judges were more lenient and likely to grant parole at the start of the day and just after lunch. They recommend regular snacking, staying hydrated, and finding ways to balance one's diet without extreme restrictions. The episode concludes with a lighthearted discussion about creative snacks, such as GORP (good old raisins and peanuts) apples and edible bread bowl spoons. Listeners are encouraged to share their experiences and photos of these creative snacks on the podcast's Discord community. The episode provides an interesting perspective on the relationship between diet, hunger, and mood, while maintaining a humorous tone throughout.
