## Summary

In this podcast episode, various topics are discussed, including the increase in the minimum wage in more than 20 states, the impact of the Permian Basin on the oil industry, and the consequences of landlords reporting rent payments to credit bureaus. The increase in minimum wage is expected to benefit nearly 10 million workers, with more than half of them being women. However, many argue that even the highest minimum wage is still far from a living wage, which is estimated to be closer to $25 an hour. In the oil industry, the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico continues to attract investors due to its resource-rich potential and industry-friendly regulations. However, some analysts believe that the cost of acquiring assets in the region may be reaching a turning point. Lastly, the podcast explores the consequences of landlords reporting rent payments to credit bureaus. While some tenants may benefit from having their regular payments reported and building good credit, others are experiencing negative impacts on their credit scores, affecting their ability to secure loans or rent new apartments.
