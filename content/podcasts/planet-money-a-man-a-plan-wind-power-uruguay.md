## Summary

In this podcast episode, the story of Uruguay's transition to renewable energy is explored. In 2007, Uruguay faced an energy crisis due to a lack of energy to meet the growing demands of its economy. Ramón Méndez Galain, a particle physicist, researched and proposed a plan to transition Uruguay's power grid to renewable energy. This plan gained the attention of the president of Uruguay, who invited Ramón to implement his strategy. Through a public-private partnership model, Uruguay attracted wind energy companies from around the world to invest in wind turbines. Today, 98% of Uruguay's grid is powered by green energy, making it a successful example of renewable energy adoption.

## Guests
