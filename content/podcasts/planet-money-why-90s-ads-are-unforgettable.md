## Summary

In this podcast episode, the hosts explore the history of advertising and how it has evolved over time. Specifically, they focus on the 90s as a peak moment for brand marketing. They discuss how advertisers in the 90s were able to make a lasting impression through catchy jingles and taglines. They highlight two iconic examples: the "Got Milk?" campaign and the "Mentos: The Freshmaker" jingle. The hosts explain that the 90s was a time of mass viewership and limited options for media consumption, which made it easier for advertisers to reach a wide audience. However, as technology advanced and media consumption habits changed, advertisers had to adapt their strategies. They now focus more on targeted and performance marketing. Though these methods may be more efficient, the hosts lament the loss of the memorable jingles and taglines that were a hallmark of 90s advertising.
