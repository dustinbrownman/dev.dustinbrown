## Summary

In this podcast episode, the host discusses inflation rates and what inflation could look like in the future. Economists predict that core inflation will be slightly above the Fed's comfort level in six months, but still lower than the current rate. While goods inflation, such as physical objects, is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels or lower, inflation for services like haircuts and car repairs may continue to rise. Food inflation is expected to decrease over the next six months, assuming good weather and continued food availability. The labor market also plays a role in inflation, with slower job growth potentially leading to reduced wage pressures and faster inflation decline. However, if the job market becomes too hot, inflation could fall more slowly. Overall, the goal is to reach the Fed's preferred target of around 2% inflation by mid-2024. Additionally, the podcast briefly discusses the challenges and trends in housing markets, as well as the lack of G-rated movies and the affordability of fish tacos at a San Diego restaurant chain.

## Highlights

- **Lack of G-Rated Movies:** The article explores the decline of G-rated movies and how family-friendly content is becoming increasingly adult-oriented. This shift is driven by the success of movies like Shrek, which had jokes that appealed to adults as well as children.
- **The Importance of Family Movies:** Family movies provide a communal experience and encourage movie-going as a family activity. While streaming platforms offer a wide range of content, the shared experience of watching a movie in a theater is something that can be lost.
- **Impact on the Movie Industry:** The decline of G-rated movies raises questions about the future of family-oriented content and the role of theaters in attracting family audiences. It also highlights the need for quality family movies that appeal to both children and adults.
