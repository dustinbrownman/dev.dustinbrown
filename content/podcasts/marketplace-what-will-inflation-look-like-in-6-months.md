## Summary

The podcast episode discusses various topics, including inflation, the lack of G-rated movies, and the affordability of fish tacos at a San Diego restaurant chain. In terms of inflation, the August Consumer Price Index showed a 3.7% increase from the previous year, but economists predict that inflation will likely decrease slightly in the next six months. The availability and prices of goods, services, and food, as well as the state of the labor market, are factors that could influence inflation rates. Additionally, the episode highlights the decline of G-rated movies and the prevalence of PG-rated films, as well as the affordable price of fish tacos at a San Diego restaurant chain despite rising food prices.
