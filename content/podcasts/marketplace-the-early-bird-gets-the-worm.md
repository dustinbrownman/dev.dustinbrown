## Summary

In this podcast episode, the focus is on various economic happenings.

The Fed wants to see a slowdown in hiring and inflation, but there are many unresolved questions about the future. In the housing market, there is a flood of new apartment buildings being completed, which may help ease rent inflation but does not solve the overall housing shortage.

The rise of orange egg yolks as a "fetish object" is also discussed, with branding and marketing playing a significant role in their popularity.
