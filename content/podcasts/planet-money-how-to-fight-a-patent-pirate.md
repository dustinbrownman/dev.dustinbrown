## Summary

In this podcast episode, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar, known as the "warrior of Haldigati," tells the story of how he fought against a turmeric patent filed by university scientists in the U.S. in the 1990s. Mashelkar was shocked by this, as using turmeric for healing wounds was a well-known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. He believed that patents should only be given for new inventions, not existing knowledge. This led him to challenge the patent and eventually win, revoking all the claims. However, this was just the beginning of a larger battle against biopiracy, as Mashelkar discovered many other traditional knowledge claims in Western patent offices. To combat this, he spearheaded the creation of a traditional knowledge digital library, which compiled ancient texts and remedies from Indian medicinal traditions. The library helped prevent, revoke, or modify over 300 patents, and its success has been a result of moral principles and defending India's ancestral knowledge. Critics argue that the library was an unnecessary waste of money, as market forces could have challenged patents on their own. However, Mashelkar believes it has been successful for the purpose it was designed for and is now expanding access beyond patent examiners.
