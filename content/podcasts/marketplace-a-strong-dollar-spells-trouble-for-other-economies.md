## Highlights

- **The Impact of a Strong Dollar:** Currency markets can be volatile, and a strong dollar can have both positive and negative effects. While a strong dollar can make imports cheaper for U.S. consumers and companies, it also increases the value of debt for other countries and makes it harder for some countries to keep investments local.

- **The Funding Dilemma of WIC:** The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in the United States provides food assistance to millions of people, but its funding is at risk due to increased participation and inflation. As Congress decides on overall funding, the debate includes whether to renew a boost in funds for fruits and vegetables and how these decisions will impact the program's ability to serve those in need.

- **The Rise of Fan Fiction:** The world of fan fiction is gaining mainstream attention, with literary agents seeking out fan fiction authors instead of the other way around. These authors are finding success by reimagining characters from popular books and movies and developing their stories into publishable works that have a ready-made audience.
