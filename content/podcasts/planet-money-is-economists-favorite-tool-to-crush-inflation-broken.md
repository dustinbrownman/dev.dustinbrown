## Summary

In this episode of the Planet Money podcast, the hosts explore the origins and impact of the Phillips Curve. The Phillips Curve, named after economist Bill Phillips, is a relationship that suggests a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Phillips, an electrical engineer turned economist, developed a water flow model to understand how the economy behaves. He observed a connection between unemployment and inflation and drew a curve to represent this relationship. This idea gained popularity and was included in textbooks, leading economists to believe they had found a stable law to guide the economy. However, Milton Friedman challenged this notion, arguing that the Phillips Curve was too simplistic and didn't account for factors like inflation expectations. The 1970s saw stagflation, which defied the predictions of the Phillips Curve and caused economists to reevaluate its validity. Despite its shortcomings, the Phillips Curve remains a tool for economists in understanding the economy, but its universal truths and predictability remain elusive.

## Highlights

- **The Birth of the Phillips Curve:** Bill Phillips, a crocodile hunter turned economist, built a water flow model in his garage to understand the economy, which eventually led to the development of the Phillips curve, a tool for guiding the economy. (highlighted in the section about Bill Phillips' water flow model)
- **The Rejection of the Phillips Curve:** Despite its initial success, the Phillips curve faced criticism from economist Milton Friedman, who argued that it was too simplistic and didn't account for factors like inflation expectations. This led to a rethinking of the curve and a loss of faith in its predictive power. (highlighted in the section about Milton Friedman's critique and the challenges faced by the Phillips curve 2.0)
- **The Complexity of Economics:** The story of the Phillips curve shows that economics is a complex field that constantly evolves as economists learn from history and adapt their understanding of how the economy works. While economists may never find universal truths, they continue to use observations and models to navigate and shape the economy. (highlighted in the conclusion about the complexity of economics and the ever-evolving nature of the field)
