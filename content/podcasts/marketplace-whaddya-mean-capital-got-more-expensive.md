## Summary

In this podcast episode, the main topics discussed are the layoffs at Spotify, the volatility of gold as an investment, the use of 3D printing in affordable housing, and the impact of interest rates on businesses. Spotify announced a round of layoffs, citing the increasing cost of capital as a major factor.

Lastly, businesses that relied on borrowing and low interest rates are now scaling back and cutting costs as interest rates increase.
