## Highlights

- **Impact of Electric Vehicles on Tax Revenue:** The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) may lead to a loss in tax revenue from traditional fuel taxes. States like Texas have imposed additional registration fees on EVs to compensate for the lost revenue. However, with the advancement of technology, EV-related patents and patent infringement may become more salient, potentially affecting the enforcement of patent law.
- **Challenges of Reading Patents:** Reading patents can be complex and time-consuming, as they are often lengthy and written in dense legal language. Artificial intelligence (AI) and technology have the potential to help analyze and sort through patents more efficiently, making it easier to identify relevant patents and enforce patents as needed.
- **Promotion and Employee Retention:** Research from ADP suggests that employees who are promoted are more likely to leave their jobs in the short term. However, the likelihood of leaving equalizes after about six months, and those who did not receive promotions are slightly more likely to leave in the long term. This highlights the complex dynamics of career advancement and employee retention in the workplace.
