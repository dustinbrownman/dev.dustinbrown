## Summary

In this episode of the podcast, the hosts challenge two researchers to step out of their comfort zones and experience something they have never done before in order to gain new insights into the economic world. In the first experiment, the researchers visit an Outback Steakhouse to investigate the claim that it is a place where people from different socioeconomic backgrounds come together. They find that the restaurant does indeed attract a diverse clientele, highlighting the importance of cross-class friendships for economic mobility. In the second experiment, the researchers explore the historical impact of technological disruption on employment by studying the decline of horse-drawn truck drivers (Teamsters) with the advent of motorized trucks. They find that as the threat of obsolescence loomed, younger people avoided the profession, while older workers entered the field seeking higher wages. Ultimately, the occupation dwindled and disappeared, highlighting the need to anticipate and address the impact of disruptive technologies on jobs.

## Highlights

- **Economic Melting Pot**: The podcast highlights a surprising finding from a research paper that shows that rich and poor people are most likely to mingle in moderately expensive chain restaurants like Applebee's or Olive Garden, rather than public parks or churches.
- **Historical Whodunit**: The podcast explores the story of the Luddites, a group of English textile workers who protested against the automation of their jobs during the Industrial Revolution. It challenges the negative perception of the Luddites and highlights the human cost of new technologies.
- **Anticipatory Dread**: The podcast discusses how workers in industries facing the threat of automation, such as truck drivers, experience anticipatory dread. It explores the impact on employment and wages, and raises questions about the future of jobs in the face of technological advancements.
