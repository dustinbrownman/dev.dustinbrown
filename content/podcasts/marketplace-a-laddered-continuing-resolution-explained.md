## Summary

House Republicans are proposing a new idea to prevent a government shutdown: a staggered funding plan, known as a laddered continuing resolution (CR), where different parts of the government would have separate funding deadlines. Experts discuss the feasibility of this approach and whether it would be effective. In other news, small businesses are creating content, airlines are offering large bonuses to experienced pilots due to a shortage, and while more Americans are behind on their debt, fewer are in collections.

## Highlights

- **Shortage of Commercial Pilots**: In the aviation industry, there is a shortage of commercial pilots, leading to recruitment efforts and bonuses offered to attract qualified aviators. This shortage has been exacerbated by factors such as early retirements, the rise of drones, and the high cost of pilot training.
- **Content Creation in Business**: Small businesses are increasingly investing in content creation, such as videos and podcasts, to showcase their products and engage with customers. This form of media generation allows businesses to demonstrate product use, provide information, and build a connection with their audience. Content creation can be a cost-effective way to promote products and drive sales.
- **The Impact of Social Media**: Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become powerful tools for businesses to reach and engage with customers. Producing engaging content that showcases products and demonstrates their use can drive sales and increase brand awareness. Social media influencers with a large following can also generate income through sponsored content and brand collaborations.
