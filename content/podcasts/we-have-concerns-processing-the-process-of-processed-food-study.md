## Highlights

- **Highlight 1: The Appeal of Ultra-Processed Foods** The study found that people instinctively look for foods with a mix of high carb to fat ratios, whether that's in a healthy or unhealthy way, suggesting that the appeal of ultra-processed foods is rooted in their composition rather than marketing or social influence.
- **Highlight 2: The Role of Packaging and Marketing** The researchers acknowledge that their study did not take into account the influence of packaging, placement of products, or social context, which are all factors that can greatly impact food choices. This suggests that the study's findings may not fully reflect real-world decision-making processes.
- **Highlight 3: Self-Reporting Limitations** The study relied on participants self-reporting their preferences based on imagined consumption of foods, which may not always accurately reflect real desires or choices. This means that the study's findings may have limitations in terms of accurately capturing people's actual food preferences.
